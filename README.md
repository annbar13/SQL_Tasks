# Task 5

*SQL Part 1*

## Subtask 1

**SELECT** * 

shows all the colummns
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

**FROM** 

the name of the table should be displayed *table_name*

**ORDER BY** 

The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in *ascending* order by default. To sort the records in *descending* order, use the *DESC* keyword.

_Example:_

SELECT column1, column2, ...

FROM table_name

ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

**WHERE** 

The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

_Example:_

SELECT column1, column2, ...

FROM table_name

WHERE condition;


**AND/OR Operators** 

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.

_Example_

SELECT column1, column2, ...

FROM table_name

WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

WHERE Color = 'Black' AND Size = 'M'

_Example_

SELECT column1, column2, ...

FROM table_name

WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

WHERE Color = 'Black' OR Color = 'Silver'

**LIKE**

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

_Example_

SELECT column1, column2, ...

FROM table_name

WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

WHERE Name LIKE 'B%' name which starts with B

WHERE Name LIKE '%b' name which ends with b

WHERE Name LIKE '%Bike%' finds values that have Bike in any position

**IS NULL**

The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values).

_Example_

SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address

FROM Customers

WHERE Address IS NULL;


**IN**

The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

_Example_

The following SQL statement selects all customers that are located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":

SELECT * FROM Customers

WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

**BETWEEN**

The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

_Example_

The following SQL statement selects all products with a price between 10 and 20:

SELECT * FROM Products

WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
